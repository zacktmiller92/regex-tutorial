# How To Match A Hex Value Using A Regular Expression

In this tutorial, I'll explain How To Match A Hex Value Using A Regular Expression.
Instead of searching through a document for hex values, you can use this regular expression to do the work for oyu. 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

Here is the code snippet of the regular expression that you'll use to identify hex values:

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

### This regular expression consists of a few main parts:

#### 1. Start with a '#' sign, but make it optional:

`/^#?`

#### 2. Match a single character in the alphabetical range a-f, or numerical range 0-9

`[a-f0-9]`

#### 3. Match the previous character set 6 times:

`{6}`

#### 4. OR:

`|`

#### 5. 


`[a-f0-9]`


#### 6. Match the previous character set 3 times: 


`{3}`


#### 7. End the regular expression

`$/`


#### Note:

The section of the regular expression enclosed in the (), separated by the '|' represents the logic of the OR statement.

`('THIS'|'THAT')`

#### BONUS: 
To make this regular expression case insensitive, add an additional range to the character classes


`/^#?([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})$/`
